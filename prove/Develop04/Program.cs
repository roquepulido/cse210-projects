/// Program: Prove: Developerâ€”Mindfulness
/// Objective: Consider an app that provides three different kinds of mindfulness opportunities.
/// It could give some guidance and structure to users in the following activities:
/// 
/// * Breathing Activity - Help the user pace their breathing to have a session of deep breathing 
/// for a certain amount of time. They might find more peace and less stress through the exercise.
/// 
/// * Reflection Activity - Guide the user to think deeply, by having them consider a certain experience 
/// when they were successful or demonstrated strength. Then, prompt them with questions to reflect more 
/// deeply about details of this experience. They might discover more depth than they previously realized.
/// 
/// * Listing Activity - Guide the user to think broadly, by helping them list as many things as they can 
/// in a certain area of strength or positivity. They might discover more breadth than they previously realized.
/// The application could additional help the user keep track of the time or frequency they spend in these 
/// activities and give them gentle prompts and reminders.
/// 
/// ** Exceeds core requirements:
/// 
///     - Added a new class for slow print, instead of just printing all the text this class provides a method to print the string,
///     so this starts typing letter by letter.
///     - Added the feature in the menu to avoid mistaken options typed.
///     - Added the feature in the method DisplayStartingMessage in the class Activity when asking for the duration of the session,
///     for ask again in case don't type a number.
///     - In the Reflecting Activity add the feature for don't have duplicated prompt questions and if all the prompt questions
///     are shown the loop ends and prints the actual time of the session.
///
